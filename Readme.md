Light Air is a tool to support **black-box system (integration) tests** of database applications for developers.

It strives for **intuitive**, simple usage and **common-sense behavior**. 

It straightens a couple of features in DbUnit and Unitils 
that are not exactly intuitive or simple to be used
and wraps [DbUnit](http://dbunit.sourceforge.net/),
[Unitils](http://www.unitils.org/) and
[JWebUnit](http://jwebunit.sourceforge.net/)
in a common, **modern usage pattern**.
